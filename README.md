# Denoising Wavelet Tranform
**This is a project from DSP course from __March 2023__ to __June 2023__**
The project is built from ***MatLab***, including two main parts:
- Audio denoising
- Image denoising
This project's purpose is to remove noise in image and audio with the application of ![wavelet multiresolution](https://www.mathworks.com/help/wavelet/ug/practical-introduction-to-multiresolution-analysis.html)

# Software requirement
**Matlab or Octave software is require**
# Results
- ** Audio Denoise **
After 3rd denoising the raw audio contain SNR as below:
![SNR](result/audio1.png)
The denoised audio graph is shown:
![audio](result/audio2.png)

- ** Image Denoise **
The RGB image is separated into R, G, B plans:

The result after and before denoising is shown as below:
